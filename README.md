# stockanalysis
Code for a self updating stock analysis dashboard



# Why?

This project serves multiple purposes. First, I'm improving my coding and data analytics skills and engaging in an interesting projects speeds up my proficiency path. Second, Stock Exchange is a black box for many people and this reality is particularly true in Brazil. I want to clear up a bit of the fog around the topic. Third, I need a clearer and faster way of deciding which stocks to buy or sell.


# How?

Most of the code will be written in Python and R. I'm still investigating how to set it up online. And it will initially address the B3 stock exchange in Brazil.
